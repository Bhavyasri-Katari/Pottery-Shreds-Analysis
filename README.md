# Pottery Shreds Analysis: A Study of Cultural Exchange Between IVC and Iranian Regions
*	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of pottery sherds from Iranian and IVC regions, utilizing Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data manipulation and analysis.
*	Investigated potential cultural exchange between the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) and Iranian regions by analyzing patterns in pottery ware, decoration, and geographic distribution. 
*	Focused on analyzing the spatial distribution of sherds across different trenches (Trench No.), revealing that the majority of pottery sherds were found in Trench No. ST.1. 
*	Examined differences in pottery-making techniques (clay paste, painting patterns, colors) between different Stratum Units (SU), identifying variations in style and a high frequency of pottery made with Buff clay paste without patterns or color. Currently analyzing comparable sites and phases for sherds by SU to further explore cultural connections and potential trade routes. 
*	Utilized data visualization techniques (matplotlib, seaborn) to explore spatial and chronological trends in the data. 
*	Employed Pandas/NumPy for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
